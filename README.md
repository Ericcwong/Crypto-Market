## About

<p>Crypto market is my take on displaying current prices and information for each cryptocurrency. The data is called from Coingecko’s API when the page loads and for future changes, I plan to make the data update with the market. The graph on the homepage is generated using Vuetify’s sparkline. The detailed graph is generated using Chart.js.</p>

## Tools Used

<ul>
<li><strong>Nuxt</strong> as the frontend framework</li>
<li><strong>Vuetify</strong> as the frontend style framework</li>
<li><strong>Chartjs</strong> to display the graph</li>
<li><strong>Vuex</strong> state management</li>
<li><strong>Vue Linkify</strong> turn links from Coingecko's API to clickable links</li>
</ul>

## Future goals with this project

<ul>
<li>Data (Prices) updates when changing</li>
<li>Along side the graph I want to add Tradingview's detailed graph</li>
<li>Better UI/UX design for better usability</li>
</ul>

## What I learned from this project

<p>A small progression to better design. Although, this project does not display any outstanding design I was able to learn more on creating grids and flex components with CSS.</p>
<p>Take a step back and read the documentation. I felt the rush to get a quick answer to solve my issue. The issue was the graph was not displaying correct information on the x-axis. I searched up and down on Stackoverflow and other web pages to get the answer. When the answer was on the Chart.js’s documentation.</p>
